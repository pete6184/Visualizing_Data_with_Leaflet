# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Requirements

For this project, I created a map using Leaflet that plots all the earthquakes in the past seven days with a magnitude over 2.5 on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

To run this map, you will first need to get an API key from https://www.mapbox.com/ and add it to the config.js file.

Then you must run the index.html file with the IDE's live server.

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding.) on issues facing our planet.
